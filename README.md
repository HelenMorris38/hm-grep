# hm-grep

Following the instructions on [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/) and writing my own grep tool.

This grep tool works for an empty string, a string of alpha characters and symbols (completing step 2 of the challenge).

I am currently working on adding functionality so that it will recurse a directory tree.
