# hm-grep

Following the instructions on [Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/) and writing my own grep tool.

This grep tool works for an empty string, a string of alpha characters and symbols, and has functionality for the -r command so it will recurse a directory tree (completing step 3 of the challenge).
